# Vision Statement

## Overview
A lightweight, intelligent command-line history tracker that
transforms shell history from a simple text log into a queryable, structured
database.

## Purpose
Modern shell users execute thousands of commands, but traditional
history mechanisms are limited - they're difficult to search, lack context, and
provide minimal insight into workflow patterns. This tool bridges that gap by
capturing rich command history data in SQLite, making it instantly searchable
and analyzable.

Provides historical context to enable work summarization

## Core Principles

**Seamless Integration**
Zero friction through zsh hooks - history tracking
happens automatically without changing user workflow or requiring explicit
actions.

**Structured Intelligence**
SQLite storage enables powerful queries: find commands by directory, timestamp,
exit status, git branch, or duration . Understand not just what you ran, but
when, where, and how it performed.

**Privacy & Control**
All data stays local. Users maintain full control over
their history database with the ability to filter, exclude, or purge sensitive
commands.

**Performance First**
Minimal overhead - tracking should be imperceptible. Fast
queries mean instant recall of relevant commands, even with years of history.

## Key Capabilities

- Rich metadata capture: command text, timestamp, working directory, exit
  status, duration
- Advanced search and filtering across all metadata dimensions
- Statistics and insights into command usage patterns
- Export and backup functionality
- Configurable retention and privacy rules

## Target Users

Developers, system administrators, and power users who live in the terminal and
want to leverage their command history as a knowledge base as well as a basic log.

## Future Direction

Evolve from simple tracking to intelligent assistance: command suggestions
based on context, workflow pattern recognition, and integration with other
shell tools to create a smarter command-line experience.
